this:
In an object method,            this refers to the object.
Alone,                          this refers to the global object.
In a function,                  this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode,  this is undefined.
In an event,                    this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
OBS.: this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.
